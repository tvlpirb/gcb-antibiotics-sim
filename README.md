**Simulation of Bacterial-Antibiotic Interactions Using Agent-based Modeling**

**Computational Question**
Can we use evolutionary simulations to model the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance under different conditions due to antibiotic effects?

**Methodology** [Rough Draft]
We will simulate three major components, pathogens, antibiotics, and enzymes which will interact in a 2D environment with each other (only vertical gene transfer). The environment will contain nutrients and the interactions between the various components will be determined by making use of existing literature for the equations and parameters provided.
Our approach towards this model will follow a bottom-up perspective where we will model individual bacteria which are agents and interact with the environment and other bacteria. 
For modeling enzyme activity and antibiotic degradation we will make use of Michaelis-Menten kinetics equations [Source: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/bi201284u]. In terms of modeling each bacterium, it will be assigned various parameters such as growth rate, nutrient uptake rate etc.
